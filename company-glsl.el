;;; Commentary:

;; Provides glsl completion by using glslangValidator.
;; glslangValidator can be found from:
;;   https://www.khronos.org/opengles/sdk/tools/Reference-Compiler/

;; To use this package with company-mode run;
;;   (add-to-list 'company-backends 'company-glsl)

;; To use this package, you must be in glsl major mode. But it doesn't
;; require any functionality from there yet.

;; This package is still quite incomplete, but it does basic symbol
;; completion. It finds all the symbols that are referenced in the
;; code or references by the linker. It can also reference function
;; names, but at the moment no other information is retained.

;; There is also no scoping, so completion candidates includes all
;; symbols, even if they are not available in the current scope. Even
;; any function parameters are seen as candidates in all other
;; functions.

;; TODO: Include GLSL keywords, maybe from glsl-mode from
;;       https://github.com/jimhourihan/glsl-mode

;; TODO: Do a better single pass parser which properly detects
;;       functions and only symbols assigned to.

;; TODO: Symbol scope
